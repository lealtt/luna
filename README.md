This is primarily a personal project, but it's open-source for anyone interested in using or learning from it.

The main goal is to keep things simple while providing a solid foundation for a Discord bot.

It utilizes the following libraries:

- **[`@lealt/nimbus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lealt/nimbus)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/lealtt/nimbus)): For handling internationalization (i18n).
- **[`@lealt/kaori`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lealt/kaori)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/lealtt/kaori)): For various utilities and builders (like components).

Feel free to explore the code!
